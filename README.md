🚀 Project: Handwritten Recognition


🏢 Company: CoderOne (Internship)


💼 Role: Data Analyst & Data Scientist Intern



Project Overview


This repository contains the implementation of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), a key area in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The project focuses on accurately detecting, classifying, and converting handwritten text from images into a digital format.

Key Features


OCR & Deep Learning: Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and deep learning models for high accuracy.


CNN & RNN Models: Implements architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for recognition.


Preprocessing Techniques: Image binarization, noise removal, and segmentation for better accuracy.


Dataset Used: Trained on popular handwritten datasets like MNIST, IAM, and custom datasets.


Evaluation Metrics: Uses Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) to assess performance.




Use Cases: Digitizing handwritten documents, signature verification, and form processing.


Installation & Usage
